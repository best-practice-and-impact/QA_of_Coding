# Preface {-}

This is an early draft of Government Statistical Service (GSS) guidance.
It forms part of the quality assurance guidance published by the Best Practice and Impact team, Office for National Statistics.

```{r out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/GSS_logo.jpg")
```

This guidance has been created to support analysts in government who use coding in their work, for example in production of statistics, modeling or data science.

## How to get the most out of this book {-}

This guidance is tailored to government analysts that would like to quality assure their code and increase the reproducibility of their analyses.
However, the practices outlined in the book are general to all applications of programming, so may also be insightful for those outside of government.
This book might be most useful for you if you are:

- writing code to automate part of your work and would like to assure that it is working as expected
- developing a statistical production pipeline and would like to assure that it is long term sustainable and reproducible
- developing models and would like to assure that they are transparent and reproducible
- developing cool new data science techniques and would like your code to be useful to others
- looking for a high level introduction to software engineering practices

This book may be most useful when used as a reference. The start of each chapter describes the risks which those practices may help to address.
Therefore, you should strive to apply the most appropriate practices given the risks associated with your work.

The book aims to be language agnostic and is not a comprehensive learning resource, so you may often need to study further resources to implement these practices. Examples and useful references are provided for **Python** and **R**, as a pair of open source languages that are commonly applied across government.


## Structure of the book {-}

The content of the book is ordered roughly in increasing difficulty. Each chapter is also broken down into sections that gradually increase in difficulty.


## Acknowledgments {-}

Where referenced, content has been adapted (or shamelessly plundered) from the [Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com), a guide to reproducible data science that is produced by the The Turing Institute.
