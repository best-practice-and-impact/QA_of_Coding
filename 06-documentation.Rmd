# Documentation

## Introduction

This chapter covers a range of methods for documenting code and coding projects.

Key to the usefulness of all of these documentation types - when your code changes, you should ensure that all relevent documentation is also updated.

## Code Documentation

### Comments

The most common form of documentation that you might come across is code comments.

Comments are useful for explaining the logic behind sections of your code.
However, excessive use of code comments often leads to redundancy and can ironically make reading your code more effortful.

```
# Set number_1 to 5
number_1 = 5

# Set number_2 to 9
number_2 = 9

# Set total to the sum of number_1 and number_2
total = number_1 + number_2
```

Comments that describe exactly **what** is occuring in the code, as above, are often not necessary.
They may be redundant, if [good naming practices](naming) are followed to self-document what is occuring in your code.
A developer or user can read your code and other documentation (see [Docstrings]) to find out what steps are carried out.
If it is difficult to understand your code without comments, then your code may overly complex and might benefit from being refactored into smaller units.

Comments can instead be used more effectively to explain **why** you might have used a particular method.
For example explaining that a piece of your code doesn't follow standard practices, perhaps because the typical method didn't work.
This type of comment may help to clarify the logic that you have used, without spelling out the individual steps taken.
Comments explaining why will help yourself and other developers to understand your intentions when writting the code.

```
# Insert demo of useful comments here


# Works around bug in function X
# TODO: Fix function x!

```

Although it is not necessary to describe your code line-by-line, it is highly beneficial to describe the overarching functionality for sections of your code.
This applies to both section of a script, as demonstrated below, and functions or classes (see [docstrings]).

For example, an anlysis script might be broken down into sections that describe each part of the analysis pipeline:

```
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


## Get data
time_series = pd.read_csv("time_Series_data.csv")

## Filter data
ten_years = time_series.loc["2010:2020"]
ten_years_price = ten_years.loc[:, "price"]

## Analyse data
median_price = ten_years_price.median()
print("Median price: " + median_price)

## Produce figures
plt.plot(ten_years_price)
```


### Docstrings

When your code is structured as functions or classes, these functional units can be efficiently documented using docstrings.
Docstrings are multiline comments that appear at the start of a function definition.
Use of these comments keeps the documentation of your code closely associated with the relevant sections of code.
Docstrings commonly describe:

- what the function or class does
- what paramaters the function or class takes as arguments
- what the code returns
- how to use section of code
- references to other functions or classes carry out similar tasks


```
def add_to_each_in_list(numbers, to_add):
    """
    Adds a number to each number in a list.

    Parameters
    ----------
    numbers : list
        Numbers to add `to_add` to.
    to_add : int or float
        Number to be added to each element of `numbers`.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        if `numbers` is not a list.

    Returns
    -------
    new_numbers : list
       `numbers` with `to_add` added to each element.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> my_numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]
    >>> add_to_each_in_list(my_numbers, 3)
    [5, 7, 9, 11]
    
    See Also
    --------
    add : Adds two numbers 
   """
   if not isinstance(numbers, list):
       raise TypeError("numbers must be a list")
   new_numbers = [number + to_add for number in numbers]
   return new numbers
```

In this example, the dosctring starts with a brief description of the overall function.
It then lists the parameters that our function takes, along with the suggested type of each and a brief description.
It also tells us that the function will raise an error if the wrong type is provided for the first parameter.
Then there is a description of the object that is returned from the function, followed by an example of the function in use.
Finally, it references a similar function.
This example follows the [numpydocs style](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html), which is particularly readable nice on the eyes.

You might find that writing function, class or package descriptions prior to writing any code helps to focus on the task at hand.
As documentation tends to be user-focussed, this may help to keep the users needs in mind when implementing the code.

### Automatic Documentation Generation

Sadly this section does not describe a tool that miraculously writes your documentation for you (though tools for [autocompleting your code](https://kite.com) do exist!).
It does, however, describe tools that automate generation of searchable, user-friendly HTML documentation.
You should ensure that the resulting documentation remains associated with the source code of your project.

Great, so you've embedded documentation into your code, in the form of docstrings.
These docstrings are great for technical users looking for a quick understanding of your code.
However, this is not the nicest format to read documentation in and it might require navigating the files containing the code to find the relevant documentation.
Thankfully tools are available to extract this information from your code and reproduce it in HTML.

We reccomend the python package [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) for generating HTML documentation.
It uses the [reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/rst/quickstart.html) markup language and supports code highlighting for multiple programming langauges within a project.
However, other tools may be required to collate documentation from code for some languages.
You can format your documentation using an [existing theme](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/tools/sphinx-themes/), or design your own.

In addition to building pretty documentation from your code, these tools can also run examples that are found within docstrings.
These examples test that your documentation is accurate and up-to-date, but may also flag when your code does not work as expected.
In sphinx, python code examples can be tested using the [doctest extension](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/doctest.html).

Tools for automatic documentation generation:

- The python package [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)
- The R package [Roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html)
- [Natural Docs](https://www.naturaldocs.org/) - open source tool that supports 20 different programming languages
- [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/)
- [JavaDoc](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html)

Be sure to read the documentation for these tools, as you may need to use a particularl docstring style or format that the tool can detect.


## Project Documentation

Whether you're developing a package or collaborating on a piece of anlaysis, documenting your project makes it much easier for others to understand your goal and ways of working.

### README

When working on a collaborative or open coding project, it's good practice to describe an overview of your project in a README file.
This allows users or developers to grasp the overall goal of your project.
As well as a description of the project, it might include examples using your code or references to other associated projects.
This file can be any text type, including `.txt`, `.md`, and `.rst`, and can be associated with your automated documentation.


### Dependencies

The simpliest way to document which packages your code is dependent on, is to record them in a text file.
This is typically called `requiements.txt`.

Python packages record their dependencies within their `setup.py` file, via `setup(install_requires=...)`.
You can get a list of your installed python packages using `pip freeze` in the command line.

R packages and projects record their dependencies in a DESCRIPTION file.
Packages are listed under the `Imports` key.
You can get a list of your installed R packages using the `installed.packages()` function.

[Environment management] tools are very useful for keeping track of software and package versions used in a project.

### User Desk Instructions

If your project it very user focussed, for example developing a statistic production pipeline, it is very important that the code users understand how to appropriately use your code.

These instructions should include:

- How to set up an environment to run your code (including how to install dependencies)
- How to run your code
- What ouputs (if any) your code or system produces and how these should be intepreted
- What quality assurance has been carried out and what further quality assurance of outputs is required


### Contributing Guidance

When collaborating, it is also useful to outline the standards used within your project.
This might include particular packages that should used for certain tasks and guidance on the [code style](code-style) used in the project.

For example, see the CONTRIBUTING file from our [gptables package](https://github.com/best-practice-and-impact/gptables/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md):

```
# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish
to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this
repository before making a change.

## Pull/merge request process

1. Branch from the `dev` branch. If you are implementing a feature name it
   `feature/name_of_feature`, if you are implementing a bugfix name it
   `bug/issue_name`.
1. Update the README.md and other documentation with details of major changes
   to the interface, this includes new environment variables, useful file
   locations and container parameters.
1. Once you are ready for review please open a pull/merge request to the
   `dev` branch.
1. You may merge the Pull/Merge Request in once you have the sign-off of two
   maintainers.
1. If you are merging `dev` to `master`, you must increment the version number
   in the VERSION file to the new version that this Pull/Merge Request would
   represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).


## Code style

- We name variables using few nouns in lowercase, e.g. `mapping_names`
  or `increment`.
- We name functions using verbs in lowercase, e.g. `map_variables_to_names` or
  `change_values`.
- We use the [numpydoc](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html)
  format for documenting features using docstrings.

## Review process

1. When we want to release the package we will request a formal review for any
   non-minor changes.
2. The review process follows a similar process to ROpenSci.
3. Reviewers will be requested from associated communities.
4. Only once reviewers are satisfied, will the `dev` branch be released.
```

In this case we have outlined our standard practices for using version control on GitHub, the code style that we are using in the project and the review process that we follow.
We have used the [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) (`.md`) markup language for this document, which is formatted into HTML when viewed on our repository.


### Vignettes

Vignettes are a form of supplementary documentation, containing applied examples that demonstrate the intented use of the code in your project or package.
Docstrings may contain examples applying individual functional units, while vignettes may show multiple units being used together.
The term vignette is usually used with reference to R packages, for example this introduction to the [{dplyr} package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html) for data manipulation.
However, the same long-form documentation is beneficial for projects in any programming language.

We've seen that docstrings can be used to describe individual functional code elements.
Vignttes provide a demonstration of the intended use for these classes and functions, in a realistic context.
This can help users to understand how different code elements interact, and how they might use your code in their own program.

Another good example is this vignette describing [how to design vignettes](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/vignettes.html) in Rmarkdown.
You can produce this type of documentation in any format, though Rmarkdown is particularly effectively at combining sections of code, code outputs and descriptive text.

You might also consider providing these examples in an interactive notebook, that users can run for themselves.


### Versioning

[Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) provides useful rules for versioning releases of your code.
Following these rules helps a user of your code to understand how changes in your code may affect their software.
Each level of version number indicates the extent of changes to the application programming interface (API) of your code, i.e. the code that a user interacts with directly.
Changes to the major version number indicate changes to the API that are not compatible with use of previous versions of the code.
While changes is the minor and patch numbers indicate changes that are either compatible or have no effect on the use of the code, respectively.

```{r fig.cap = "[Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)", out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/semantic_versioning.png")
```

### Changelog

A changelog records the major changes that have occured to a project or package, between versioned releases of the code.

```
# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0] - 2020-01-21
### Added
- `add_to_each_in_list()`
- online sphinx-generated documentation
- contribution guide

### Removed
- `subtract_to_each_in_list()`

### Changed
- Improved function documentation

### Fixed
- bug in `multiple_each_in_list()`, where output was not returned
```

Similarly to versioning, a changelog is useful for users to determine whether an update to your code is compatible with their work which may depend on your code.
It can also document which parts of your code will no longer be supported in future version and which bugs in your code have been addressed.
Your changelog can be in any format and should be associated with your code documentation, so that it is easy for users and other contibutors to find.

[keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) provides a simple but effective template for recording changes to your code.


### License

Software licences are important for users and developers to understand how they can use, modify and redistribute your code.

In government, we [support and promote open source](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-12-make-new-source-code-open) whenever possible.
Open source projects are those which freely release their source code for modification and redistribution.
As a government analyst, you should try to make all new source code open, unless justification can provided for withholding part of your source code.
This openess encourages collaboration and provides transparency in government analysis.

Please see the [GDS guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-source-guidance/when-code-should-be-open-or-closed) for when code should be open or closed.
Additional security concerns for coding in the open are addressed in further [GDS guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-source-guidance/security-considerations-when-coding-in-the-open).

All code produced in government departments and agencies is covered by [Crown Copyright](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/re-using-public-sector-information/uk-government-licensing-framework/crown-copyright/).
Where possible, this material is released under the [Open Government Licence (OGL)](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).

Where Crown copyright material is covered by the Open Government Licence, others can:

- Copy, publish, distribute and transmit the information
- Adapt the information
- Exploit the information commercially and non commercially for example, by combining it with information of your own

However, users must acknowledge the source of the information and reference the licence.
