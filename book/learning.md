# Learning Resources

This section links to training and self-led learning resources, which relate to the sections of the guidance.

Many of these learning resources point to the UK Statistics Authority Learning Hub, which are labelled as "government analysts only". Government analysts can request an account for the Hub via [gss.capability@ons.gov.uk](mailto:gss.capability@ons.gov.uk).

Please note that learning resources from non-government training providers may not follow good practices. However, exposure to a range of applied examples will still benefit your learning. You should compare and contrast your learning to the good practices outlined in the guidance.

## Core programming

You should look to these sources for introductory learning, before reading this guidance:
