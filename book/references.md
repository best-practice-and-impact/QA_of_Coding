When asking for help from your peers, Slack or online communities like [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), it's best to provide a [minimal, reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example).
Without a simplified example, it can be difficult to diagnose your problem and suggest potential solutions.
You might even find that breaking the problem down to simplify the example may even lead to a solution.
