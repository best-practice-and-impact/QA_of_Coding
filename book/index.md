This guidance has been created to support analysts in government who use coding in their work. Including those who produce statistics, carry out modelling or apply data science.

## Structure of the book

The content of the book is ordered roughly in increasing depth. Each chapter is also broken down into sections that gradually increase in difficulty. 
We have noted a rough guide to difficulty for each section using a ★★★★★ rating system.


## How to get the most out of the book

This guidance is tailored to government analysts that would like to quality assure their code and increase the reproducibility of their analyses.

However, the practices outlined in the book are general to many applications of programming, so may also be insightful for those outside of government.
This book might be most useful for you if you are:

- writing code to automate part of your work and would like to assure that it is working as expected
- developing a statistical production pipeline and would like to assure that it is long term sustainable and reproducible
- developing models and would like to assure that they are transparent and reproducible
- developing data science techniques and would like your code to be useful to others
- looking for a high level introduction to software engineering practices in the context of analysis and research

This book may be most useful when used as a reference. The start of each chapter describes the risks which those practices may help to address.
Therefore, you should strive to apply the most appropriate practices given the risks associated with your work.

The principles in this book are language agnostic - as such it does not form a comprehensive learning resource and you may often need to study further resources to implement these practices.
That said, examples and useful references are provided for **Python** and **R**, as a pair of open source languages that are commonly applied across government.


## Accessibility statement

This accessibility statement applies to the quality assurance of code guidance.

The website is managed by the Best Practice and Impact division of the Office for National Statistics.
We would like this guidance to be accessible for as many people as possible.
This means that you should be able to:
* change colours, contrast levels and fonts
* zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
* navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
* navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
* listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We know that some parts of the guidance are not currently fully accessible:
* tabbed content (e.g. code examples) cannot be focussed and switched using a keyboard

### Feedback and reporting accessibility problems

We’re always looking to improve the accessibility of our guidance.
If you find any problems not listed on this page or think that we’re not meeting accessibility requirements, please contact us by email at [gsshelp@statistics.gov.uk](mailto:gsshelp@statistics.gov.uk).
Also please get in touch if you are unable to access any part of this guidance, or require the content in a different format.

### Enforcement procedure

The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’).
