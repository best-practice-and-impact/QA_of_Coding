# Peer Review

Peer review of code is a quality assurance activity, where a developer other than the code's author views and tests the usage of piece of code.

## Pair programming

> Two heads are better than one

This practice combines the code writing and review process into one step.
Here, two or three developers work together on a writing a single piece of code.
Each developer takes turns to actively author parts of the code, while others provide real time feedback on the code being written.

This encourages developers to think about and vocalise why they are writing code in a particular way.
It gives reviewers a chance to suggest improvements and question the author's approach as they write code.
The rotational aspect of this practice ensures that all team members gain experience from both the author and review perspective.
From both angles,  you'll to learn new techniques and practices.

If used regularly, this approach can help you to get used to receiving constructive feedback and being more open to improve your coding practices.

An alternative to this is the over-the-shoulder review technique, where one developer authors for the entire session.
This can be useful when working with a mentor, but it is often more useful for a mentor to lead by example.


## Remote Review

This approach essentially involves sharing your code with a reviewer, and receiving comments following the review.

This can work best within an Agile working pattern, where changes are little and often. Requesting review of small but regular changes reduces the burden, relative to large review of a complete project.

The thought of someone else reviewing your code in this way encourages good practices from the outset:
* Clear code and documentation - so that others with no experience can use and test your code
* Usable dependency management - so that others can run your code in their own environment
